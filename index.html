            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Benguet is a landlocked province in the Philippines located in the Cordillera Administrative Region in Luzon. It is known for its mountainous terrain, cool climate, and rich culture.</p>
            <p>The province of Benguet was established in 1901 during the American colonial period. It was originally a part of the old Mountain Province until it became a separate province. Benguet played a significant role in the mining industry, particularly in gold and copper mining, which contributed to its economic development.</p>
            <p> The mountainous area now covered by Benguet is generally presumed to have been settled from at least the 14th century by tribes coming from the surrounding lowlands, lured by the abundance of natural resources such as gold, hides, and wax. Two of these groups, the Ibaloi and the Kankanaey, are dominant ethnolinguistic groups of the area. In the pre-conquest period, these tribes enjoyed flourishing trade with lowland groups immediately to their west and south, such as the Pangasinans. Governor Juan "Oraa" Cariño (1913-1918), one of Benguet’s governors, was the first Filipino governor.</p>

Kankanaeys dominate the northwestern municipalities, Ibalois are concentrated on the southeast, and Kalanguyas are mostly found in the east.[6][36][37] Migrants from lowland provinces have fused with the local populace to form a melting pot in some[vague] areas.</p> <p> According to the 2000 Philippine census, Kankanaeys comprised 42.96% (141,434) of the entire provincial household population of 329,216 at the time, while 29.15% (95,968) were identified as Ibalois, and 3.69% (12,147) were Ikalahan/Kalanguya.
